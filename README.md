# dispatch

**Signal-driven task orchestrator for MCP servers.**

One LLM dispatches multiple MCP tool calls concurrently, then goes idle. `dispatch` runs those tasks in parallel and only wakes the LLM when a signal arrives — a task completes, fails, or needs attention.

Multi-agent-level parallelism without loading multiple LLM instances.

## Why

Most LLM orchestration systems either run tasks sequentially (slow) or spawn multiple LLM agents (expensive). `dispatch` takes a different approach: **one brain, many hands.** The LLM is the decision maker. MCP servers are the workers. `dispatch` is the nervous system — routing signals, tracking processes, and waking the brain only when there is something to reason about.

## Architecture

```
LLM (any model, via client app)
 │
 │  MCP protocol (stdio)
 ▼
dispatch (Rust, Tokio async runtime)
 │
 │  Spawns tasks, routes signals
 ▼
dmcp (MCP server manager)
 │
 │  Discovers, runs, invokes
 ▼
MCP Servers (git, shell, browser, ...)
```

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **LLM** | Decision maker. Produces dispatch lists, interprets signals. |
| **dispatch** | Orchestrator. Spawns tasks, assigns PIDs, manages signal queue, fires reminders, exposes MCP interface. |
| **dmcp** | Server manager. Discovers installed MCP servers, handles install/config/invocation. Required on PATH. |
| **MCP servers** | Workers. Execute actual operations (git, file I/O, web search, etc). |

## Requirements

- [dmcp](https://github.com/YakupAtahanov/dmcp) installed and on PATH
- Rust toolchain (for building from source)

```bash
# Install dmcp first
cargo install --git https://github.com/YakupAtahanov/dmcp

# Build dispatch
cargo build --release
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

```bash
dispatch serve    # Run as MCP server (stdio)
dispatch help     # Show help
```

Add to your MCP client config (Claude, Cursor, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dispatch": {
      "command": "dispatch",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Tools

| Tool | Description | Parameters |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `dispatch` | Dispatch tasks for concurrent execution | `tasks: [{server, tool, params, remind_after?}]` |
| `kill` | Terminate running tasks by PID | `pids: [int]` |
| `wait` | Acknowledge reminder, keep tasks running | `pids: [int]` |
| `status` | Get current state of all active tasks | — |
| `log` | Get the signal window (last N entries) | `count?: int` (default: 20) |
| `timer` | Set a one-shot timer that fires a REMIND signal after a duration | `label: string`, `duration: int` (seconds), `metadata?: object` |

## Signals

Every event is a signal. The signal window (last 20 entries) is the LLM's working memory.

| Signal | Meaning | Triggered by |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `INIT` | Task started | dispatch (on spawn) |
| `EXIT` | Task finished (success or failure) | Task completion |
| `REMIND` | Task running beyond threshold | dispatch (timer) |
| `WAIT` | LLM acknowledged reminder, continuing | LLM response |
| `KILL` | Task terminated | LLM response |

[14:02:01] PID 1 INIT    git pull origin main
[14:02:01] PID 2 INIT    browser search "Rust async patterns"
[14:02:02] PID 1 EXIT    Already up to date.
[14:02:05] PID 2 EXIT    Found 12 results: ...
```

## Example Session

User: *"Update my repo, check open issues, and find API docs."*

```
[14:02:00] PID 1 INIT    git pull origin main
[14:02:00] PID 2 INIT    github issues list --state open
[14:02:00] PID 3 INIT    dmcp browse keywords=["api", "documentation"]

[14:02:01] PID 3 EXIT    Found: openapi-mcp (validate, generate, serve)
[14:02:02] PID 1 EXIT    Updated. 3 files changed.
[14:02:03] PID 2 EXIT    4 open issues: #12 "Fix auth", #15 "Add tests", ...

→ dispatch wakes LLM — LLM dispatches follow-up:

[14:02:04] PID 4 INIT    openapi-mcp generate --spec ./api/v2.yaml
[14:02:06] PID 4 EXIT    Generated docs at ./docs/api-v2.html

→ LLM responds to user with summary
```

Total LLM invocations: 3. Wall time: ~6 seconds. Parallel tasks: 3.
